# Security, Compliance, and Identity OpenHack Execution Specifics

This document will discuss the prerequisites to run a Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI) OpenHack. It includes assets you need to host/point to, coach resources, event structure, and TODOs for each section.

## Challenge resource deployment

OpenHack participants will create challenge personas and resources in Azure AD and Azure.

### TO DO
Each team will:
* Need to sign up for an Office 365 E5 trial account and associate an EMS E5 trial account and Azure trial subscription. This will create a single Azure AD directory and support the OpenHack's scenario that this is a single fictitious company using these Microsoft products.
* Create challenge personas and groups using a PowerShell script.
* Deploy resources in their Azure trial subscription.

#### Sign up for a Microsoft account and an Office 365 E5 trial subscription

#### Create Azure resources

The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template located at [https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack/blob/main/byos/sci/scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenHack/blob/main/byos/sci/scripts.zip) should be executed against a new resource group named **OpenHackRG** in the target Azure subscription.  The Azure resources are used throughout the OpenHack to provide basic elements used by the fictitious company.

There are no ARM template parameters to provide (resource names are hard-coded within the template).

Use the Microsoft Azure portal to create the resource group and deploy the custom template, or you may use the following commands:

```PowerShell
$location = "eastus"
$resourceGroupName = "OpenHackRG"
$deploymentName = "azuredeploy" + "-" + (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().ToString('MMdd-HHmmss')

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location -Force
